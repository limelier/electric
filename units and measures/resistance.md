**Resistance** is the measure of opposition to electric current. It is the opposite of [[conductance]].

Resistance is annotated $R$ and measured in [[ohm|ohms]].

A circuit with little to no resistance - a **short circuit** - will allow a large amount of current to flow through it, which can be dangerous (it may heat up, for example).

The resistance of a component or material can vary with temperature.

The resistances of components connected [[series and parallel|in series]] can be added up into a single value.
