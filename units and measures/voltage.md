**Voltage** is a measure of *potential energy* available per *unit charge*. Voltage is always expressed as a quantity *between* two points, and will only be non-zero if there is [[resistance]] between them. 

Voltage is annotated $E$ (electromotive force) or $V$ and is measured in [[volt|volts]]. A voltage over a brief period of time can be annotated with a lowercase $e$ or $v$ as well.

One source of voltage is a [[battery]].

Because of the analogy between voltage and the potential energy of a weight raised above the ground, voltage is also sometimes referred to as a voltage "drop".

When a voltage source is connected to a circuit, it will cause a flow of electrons through it called a [[current]].

The +/- orientation of a voltage drop is called the [[polarity]]. This is often annotated on circuits in diagrams.
