The voltage divider formula is used for calculating the [[voltage|voltage drop]] of one resistor of several connected in series by its fraction of total [[resistance]].

For $n$ resistors $R_1, R_2, \dots, R_n$ connected in series, the voltage drop of any one will be: 
$$ E_k = E_{total} \frac{R_k}{R_{total}} $$
