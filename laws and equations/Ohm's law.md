Ohm's law is a relation between [[current]], [[voltage]] and [[resistance]]. Specifically, it takes the form of three equivalent algebraic expressions:
- $V = IR$
- $I = V/R$
- $R = V/I$

[[Joule's law]] is sometimes regarded as being part of Ohm's law.

An analogy for Ohm's law as water in a pipe might view the three values as:
- [[voltage]] is analogous to the *pressure* of the water
- [[current]] is analogous to the *flow rate* of the water
- [[resistance]] is analogous to how much the pipe resists the flow of water

As such:
- with resistance steady, more current will also mean more voltage
- with voltage steady, more resistance will mean less current (and vice-versa)
- with current steady, more resistance will take more voltage to overcome

As a rule of thumb, the variables used in Ohm's law equations must be common to the same two points in the circuit under consideration. The [[table method]] is also a good way to keep track of variables - you're only allowed to apply Ohm's law to a single column at a time.
