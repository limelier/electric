- Rubbing two objects together can transfer electrons from one to the other, making them positively- and negatively-charged
- A moving magnetic field will induce an electrical current in a coil of wire
- Electric fields are, by convention, the forces that act upon negatively charged particles (`-` -> `+`)
- `-` repels `-` and attracts `+`
- Net electric charge: $Q_{net} = +e \times (n_p - n_e)$ - the difference of electrons and protons times the charge of a proton
	- $+e = 1.60217663 Ã— 10^{-19} C$
- Coulomb's Law: $$
  F = k_e \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}
 $$where $F$ is the electric force, $Q_n$ is the electrical charge of each object, $r$ is the distance between the objects, and $k_e$ is the Coulomb constant: $$
 k_e = 9 \times 10^9 Nm^2/C^2
 $$
 - Ions in a solution under put through an electric field will separate, creating their own electric field which will weaken or cancel out the outside one
	 - When the electric field is completely cancelled out, the separation will cease
 - Two parallel charged plates with equal and opposite charges, put close together, can be used to create an almost uniform electric field in-between them
