Laying out a table with (groups of) components as columns and measures as rows is a good way to keep calculations ordered and correct. For example:

| measure | $R_1$ | $R_2$ | $R_3$ | Total | Unit |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| V | 1.5 | 5 | 2.5 | **9** | V |
| I | 500μ | 500μ | 500μ | 500μ | A |
| R | **3k** | **10k** | **5k** | 18k | $\Omega$ |
| P | 750μ | 2500μ | 1250μ | 4500μ | W |
