Electrical current can produce burns in the body due to power dissipation across the body's electrical [[resistance]].

*Tetanus* is the condition where muscles involuntarily contract due to passage of external electric current through the body. This can cause all sorts of issues, including not being able to let go of an energized conductor (*freezing on the circuit*).

DC is more likely to cause muscle tetanus than AC, while AC is more likely to cause a victim's heart to fibrillate.

[[Grounding]] exists only to make part of a circuit safe to touch. In a simple two-wire power system, the [[conductor]] connected to ground is called the "neutral", and the other one is called "hot", "live" or "active". A **ground fault** is an unintended connection between a circuit and the ground.

Harm to the body is a function of [[current]]. Higher [[voltage]] allows for the production of higher, more dangerous currents. Resistance opposes voltage, making high resistance a good protective measure against shock. 

Any voltage above 30 V is generally considered to be capable of delivering dangerous shock currents.

*Zero Energy State*: when a system or device has been secured so that no potential energy exists that could harm someone working on it.

*Lock-out/Tag-out*: a padlock and tag based system for securing a system or device so that it cannot be reactivated without the removal of each worker's padlock.

Various common safety devices include:
- polarized plugs
- double insulation
- three-prong "grounding" plugs
- ground fault current interrupters
