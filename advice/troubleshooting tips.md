In general, troubleshooting how a circuit behaves with a [[short circuit|short]] or an [[open circuit failure]] involves redrawing the diagram with the short or break included and recalculating all the values. The [[table method]] can help.

It's worth noting that resistors tend to fail open more often than shorted, and rarely fail unless over-stressed physically or electrically.
## Short circuit
If circuit current is higher than expected, look for a short circuit in one or more of the components. Measuring the voltage across each component can help identify the short's location - the shorted component will have a very low voltage drop across it

Common causes of short circuits can include:
- Device failure
- Moisture damage
- Solder migration
- Shorted components

In a [[series and parallel#Parallel|parallel]] circuit, a short across one of the branches will cause current to bypass the other two.
## Open circuit failure
If a circuit current is much too low or even zero, there is probably a break somewhere in the circuit. Using a voltmeter, we could find the section of circuit that has most or all of the voltage dropped across it - this'll be the location of the open circuit.

Open circuit failures can be caused by broken connections due to vibration, shock, or device failures.

In a [[series and parallel#Parallel|parallel]] circuit, a break in one of the branches will cause the total [[resistance]] to rise, lowering the [[current]].
