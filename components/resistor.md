A **resistor** is a component that provides a precise amount of [[resistance]].

The most common symbol for a resistor is a zigzag line:

The name (usually R$_n$) of a resistor, along with its value, is usually annotated next to its symbol.

An alternative symbol for a resistor is a box, which is more similar to their real-life appearance:

## Variable resistor
Resistors can also be shown to have varying, rather than fixed, resistance, by overlapping them with a "modifier" arrow symbol:

This can be the case if the resistor is adjustable, or if it is just a component with an unstable resistance. 

## Power rating
Resistors dissipate heat energy as electric currents go through them. Different resistors can dissipate different amounts of heat safely, and are rated for a certain amount of [[power]]. This rating will be specified in [[watt|watts]].

## Color codes
Resistors are typically labelled with 3, 4 or 5 color bands. These are grouped as follows:
- 2 or 3 digit bands
- 1 multiplier band (number of trailing zeroes, or multiplier power of 10)
- 1 optional tolerance band (if absent, tolerance is 20%)
The tolerance band is separated from the rest by a bigger gap, which indicates the reading direction.
