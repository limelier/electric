## Temporary
Alligator clips are one option, but they're quite tedious and fragile.

Solder-less [[breadboard|breadboards]] are boards with strips of electrically-common spring-loaded contacts allowing for easy temporary connections. They are the most common kind of tool for circuit prototyping.
## Long-term
[[Soldering]] (low-temperature welding using a conductive alloy) and [[wire-wrapping]] (small-gauge wire wrapped around component terminals) are more long term ways of connecting wires and components.

Soldering components together is usually done on a board. This can be a perforated board that just acts as support for the components ("[[perfboard]]"), or can be a full-blown PCB ([[printed circuit board]]) that also has connections between the components on it.

Another tool you can use is the [[terminal strip]], a strip of screw-in connectors that can easily temporarily or permanently attach conductors to each other.
