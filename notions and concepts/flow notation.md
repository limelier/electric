**Conventional flow notation** designates charge flow from `+` to `-`. This is most commonly used by electrical engineers.

**Electron flow notation** designates charge flow from `-` to `+`, and is more accurate to reality (negatively-charged objects have more electrons, which will move to positively-charged objects with fewer).

Notation matters because of things like [[polarization|polarized]] electrical components.
