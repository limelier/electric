A **short circuit** is a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] that allows current to travel along an unintended path with very little or no [[resistance]]. This will lead to a higher [[current]] than intended, which can damage components and lead to fires.

The opposite of a short circuit is an [[open circuit failure]].

"Short" can also be used as a verb:
- (of a device) to malfunction or fail as a result of a short circuit
- (of a person) to cause a short circuit in a circuit
