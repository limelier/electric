- rubbing two objects together can sometimes result in them becoming electrically charged
- one object will take electrons from the other, leaving them positively- and negatively-charged
- the **elementary charge**: $+e = 1.60217663 Ã— 10^{-19}C$
- **static electricity**: the imbalance of electrons between two objects insulated from each other
