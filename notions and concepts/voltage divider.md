A voltage divider is a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] that produces an output [[voltage]] which is a fraction of its input voltage.

A simple example of a voltage divider is two [[resistor|resistors]] connected [[series and parallel|in series]], with the output voltage being drawn from between them. This works with the [[voltage divider formula]].
