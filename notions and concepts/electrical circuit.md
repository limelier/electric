An electric circuit is a looped pathway of conductive material that supports the flow of electrons within it.

If a circuit is "broken", its conductive elements no longer form a complete path, so a continuous charge flow can no longer occur within it. This is true regardless of where the break is.

A **short circuit** is one with little or no [[resistance]]. It can allow a high current, which can be dangerous with a high-[[voltage]] power source, as it can cause large amounts of energy to be released.

An **open** circuit is discontinuous, and does not allow the flow of electricity. A **closed** circuit is continuous.
